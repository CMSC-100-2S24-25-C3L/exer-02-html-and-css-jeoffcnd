        <h2>Skills</h2>

        <p> My abilities, in my opinion, are more centered on perseverance in learning; even if I struggle with a foreign program language, particularly early in the course, I am not very good at quickly adjusting to new situations. However, I have discovered that I am genuinely committed to improving my performance and want to learn as much as I can. That, in my opinion, is the secret to being able to learn everything, particularly for every course that uses a different programming language, like the CMSC 100 one we are using right now.</p>
