The main lesson I learned was that learning HTML and CSS takes time because it requires creativity in the output we produce for each concept we have.
It relates to understanding how we will be able to code it. We will be able to accomplish two goals at once because writing our code will improve our creativity and teach us new things. My key takeaway is it really takes time to learn the html and css functionalities as it invokes our cretivity in the output we are doing were for every idea we think, it corresponds in knowing how will we be able to code it. Here, we will be able to hit 2 birds in 1 stone as it will make our creativity more better and gain more knowledge in the process of making our code.
